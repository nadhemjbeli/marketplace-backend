# 🏡 Event-Driven Marketplace Backend (Monolith Phase)

This project is the **first milestone (Month 1–2)** in my journey from Mid → Senior Backend Developer.  
It’s a **monolithic backend API** simulating a simplified Airbnb/Fiverr platform.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Node.js + Express**
- **GraphQL (Apollo Server)**
- **PostgreSQL + Prisma**
- **JWT Authentication + Role-Based Access Control**
- **TypeScript**

## 📌 Features
- User registration & login with JWT
- Role-based access (Admin / User)
- Listings CRUD (title, description, price)
- Bookings workflow (create & manage bookings)
- PostgreSQL schema with relations & migrations (Prisma)

## 🎯 Purpose
This project demonstrates how to:
1. Move beyond basic CRUD APIs.
2. Implement authentication & authorization.
3. Design a relational schema for marketplace-style apps.
4. Prepare for event-driven refactoring in the next phase.
